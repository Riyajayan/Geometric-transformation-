# Geometric-transformation-
This project shows geometric transformations on a square using Python (OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib). It covers Euclidean (rotation/translation), Similarity (rotation, scaling, translation), Affine (3-point mapping with shear/scale/rotate), and Projective (4-point perspective). Each block displays original vs transformed square.
